# MPGMRESSh.jl
This `julia` package provides a proof-of-concept implementation of the multi-preconditioned GMRES iterative solution method for shifted systems
of linear problems (see [Bakhos T. et al., Multipreconditioned GMRES for Shifted Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08970)).

As of now, it is still in an early experimental stage.
